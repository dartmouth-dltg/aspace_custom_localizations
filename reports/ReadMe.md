Place your report localization(s) here. Note that the labels/keys must remain in English
and should be the same set as found in any of the core localizations. For ease of contributing
these to core, place them in the same structure as found in core. Core localizations for reports
typically nest in a directory structure: `reports/{REPORT_GROUP}/{REPORT_NAME}/{LANGUAGE}.yml`
